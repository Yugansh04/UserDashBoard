## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0BFFF) to convey tranquility and focus.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F5F3FF), almost white, to maintain a clean and unobtrusive aesthetic.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#B197FC), for interactive elements like checkboxes and buttons.
- Clean, sans-serif font to ensure readability across devices.
- Responsive layout using Flexbox or Grid to adapt to different screen sizes. Profile section will be on the left side, with the Task List and Statistics Display on the right.
- Simple, outline-style icons for task management (e.g., checkmark for completed, plus sign for adding tasks).
- Subtle transition animations for task completion and reordering to enhance user experience.
